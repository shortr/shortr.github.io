        <h1>It appears that the link you clicked on is invalid or was formatted incorrectly</h1>
        <p>Here are some ideas to solve your problem:
        - Try to remove characters in the url bar above until it looks like the correct url
        - Try to make it into a url...
        - Try a different link: such as <a href="https://shortr.github.io/?A">this!</a>
